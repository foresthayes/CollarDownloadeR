Package: CollarDownloadeR
Version: 0.0.1
Title: Automate downloading of telemetry data from manufacturer's websites
Description: Telemetry collars make it easy to collect large quantities of data,
    but it can be difficult and time consuming to retrieve this data from 
    website interfaces.  This package is a collection of functions to help users
    automate data retrieval.  For those companies with established APIs the user
    can query data stores directly and for those companies with websites or 
    other more difficult means of distributing data web scraping and related 
    techniques are used to help ease data retrieval.
